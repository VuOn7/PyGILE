# The PyGILE Course

A complete, hands-on course in Python and geospatial science for **absolute beginners**: no coding and no GIS experience needed. Every example uses data from Nepal and the Himalaya.

> **Status:** complete: 39 lessons and 1,061 practice questions, from your first line of Python to satellite time series. The course ends with Part D; [PyGILE-Plus](https://github.com/Geoinformatics-Lab/PyGILE-Plus) continues from there.

Every lesson has a navigation bar at the top and bottom, so you can move through the course like a book: **← Previous · Course home · Next →**.

## How every lesson works

Each lesson is a Jupyter notebook made of short **steps**. Every step has:

1. **Theory:** one idea, explained in plain English.
2. **Example:** code you run, on Nepal data.
3. **Practice:** three questions that get harder:
   - **Q1** needs one line of code,
   - **Q2** needs two lines,
   - **Q3** needs about three lines.

Type your answer in the empty cell under each question, run it, then click **Show solution** to check. Each lesson also shows a real error message and how to read it, ends with longer **mixed review** exercises, and finishes with a recap and a glossary of new words.

**The rule that makes it work:** try every question before you open the solution. Being stuck for a few minutes is not failure; it is how the skill is built.

## Before you start

Install the `pygile` environment (see the main [README](../README.md)), open JupyterLab, and start with **A1**. In each notebook, use **Kernel → Restart Kernel and Run All Cells** if results ever look strange.
